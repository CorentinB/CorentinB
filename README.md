### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Corentin and I am 26 years old.
I work as a Software Engineer at Mistral AI, and I previously worked for 6 years at the Internet Archive, crawling the web in the Wayback Machine team.

I am passionate about digital archiving for almost a decade now and you can find a lot of projects related to that on my GitHub.

My favorite language is Go but I am open to learn any new technology.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - [Zeno](https://github.com/CorentinB/Zeno) - A state-of-the art web crawler ðŸ”±
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  - Any archiving project
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - How great France is, but how terrible our government is
- âš¡ Fun fact:
  - I used to practice hypnosis on my friends when I was in high school
  - I collect physical media
  - I collect many other things
  - I collect too many things
