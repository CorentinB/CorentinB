### Hi there 👋

I'm Corentin and I am 26 years old.
I work as a Software Engineer at Mistral AI, and I previously worked for 6 years at the Internet Archive, crawling the web in the Wayback Machine team.

I am passionate about digital archiving for almost a decade now and you can find a lot of projects related to that on my GitHub.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - [Zeno](https://github.com/internetarchive/Zeno) - A state-of-the-art web crawler in Go 🔱
  - [gowarc](https://github.com/internetarchive/gowarc) - A state-of-the-art WARC library in Go 💾
  - [gocdx](https://github.com/internetarchive/gocdx) - A state-of-the-art CDX library in Go 📝
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Any archiving project
- 💬 Ask me about:
  - How great France is, but how terrible our government is
- ⚡ Fun fact:
  - I used to practice hypnosis on my friends when I was in high school
  - I collect physical media
  - I collect many other things
  - I collect too many things

My two "life projects" are [Zeno](https://github.com/internetarchive/Zeno) and its companion library [gowarc](https://github.com/internetarchive/gowarc). I have poured my heart and soul into them, and I try to continue maintaining them wherever life takes me.
